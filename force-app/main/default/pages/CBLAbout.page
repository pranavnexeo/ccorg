  <h1>Chatter Blacklist - <i>"Keeping the conversation clean."</i></h1>
</p><p>  
  <h2>What is it?</h2>
  </p><p>  
  Chatter Blacklist is an application that allows organizations to add a series of words or phrases to a 
  blacklist---a list of words which do are disallowed by company policies or compliance rules. Such words may include 
  swear words, racist statements, sexist remarks, and more.
  </p><p>  
  Words added to the blacklist will be automatically checked whenever a user posts via Chatter with the offending words
  scrubbed from the post, comment, or User's current status with the option of an administrator being notified of the breach of conduct.
   </p><p>
   If you want to get started quickly, check out <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aExYvke-M98" rel="vidbox 800 600" title="Chatter Blacklist by Quinton Wall">this quick 3min intro video</a> which will cover everything you need. (Go on, I know you really want to click it, don't you?)
  </p><p>  
  <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
  </p><p>  
  Using Chatter Blacklist is easy, simply navigate to the Blacklisted Words tab, add a word or phrase, and save the record.
  By default, words are scrubbed from posts using the '****' annotation. Scrubmarks can be defined for each particular word by modify the Substitution field when entering a Blacklisted word.
  </p><p>  
  <h3>How it works</h3>
  </p><p>  
  Each blacklisted word or phrase is converted into a Regular Expression. You can see the generated expression in the RegexValue field of a particular
  record. This field can be manually updated by someone familiar with regular expressions. Warning: manually updating a regular expression
  should be done with care. Regular Expressions can be complicated and may cause Chatter Blacklist to fail to match a work correctly.
  You can also match phrases. For example, if you want to prevent posts which get generated for "just installed Chatter for Application X", simply create 
  a new entry with the Word/Phrase set to "just installed Chatter" and select "Prevent post on breach." Cool huh :)
   <h3>What are the current options</h3>
  </p>For each word you can configure the following<p>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Word</b> - the actual word which you wish to black list.</li>
  <li><b>Substitution string</b> - what characters do you wish to substitute the blacklisted word with? defauts to ***</li>
  <li><b>Add To Compliance Audit</b> - checking this will write the out of compliance post, in its unscrubbed form to the Blacklist Audit object
   including the word which caused the breach, and the user who entered the post. <b>Note:</b> Email notifications etc, can easily be created based on inserts into the Blacklist Audit table via 
   standard Salesforce workflow and field update rules.</li>
  <li><b>Prevent Post on Breach</b> - if checked, the system will return an error message to the user rather than posting a scrubbed version of their post. 
  Posts will still be sent to Blacklist Audit if the Add to Compliance check is enabled.</li>
  <li><b>Match Whole Words Only</b> - checking this will match the word if only the entire word matches. eg: If the blacklisted word was 'bum'. 'bummer' would not</li>
   trigger a compliance breach if Match Whole Words Only was checked.
   <li><b>Is Active</b> - This field, which is checked by default, allows you enable or disable specific words without deleting them. When unchecked, a specific
   word will not be used in filters.</li>
   <li><b>Regex Value</b> - Chatter Blacklist generates the regular expression value required to match the words. This field is read only and used internally by the system.</li>
  </ul>
