            This Agreement shall be effective for the term beginning: <b>{!TODAY()}</b>, and shall continue for a period of two (2) years (the &quot;Initial Term&quot;) unless sooner terminated as provided herein.&nbsp; Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (the &quot;Renewal Term&quot;) unless (a) the CONTRACTOR gives the OWNER at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of termination prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term, or (b) OWNER gives the CONTRACTOR written notice of termination within thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term or (c) the Contract is terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; This Agreement is intended to eliminate the necessity of preparing individual contracts on future occasions that we might wish to arrange with you to furnish labor, materials, and supervision, or any of them, to OWNER., its subsidiaries and affiliates (&ldquo;OWNER&rdquo;).&nbsp; By entering into this Agreement, the OWNER makes no guarantee of the volume of work or services the CONTRACTOR may provide hereunder and CONTRACTOR shall not commence any work or services or incur any costs under this Agreement until the OWNER has issued a Purchase Order covering the same.&nbsp; Any purchase order of OWNER, specifications, plans or schedules approved in writing by OWNER and CONTRACTOR shall be considered part of the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <strong>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SCOPE OF WORK</strong></p>
        <p>
            Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, CONTRACTOR undertakes to provide OWNER with the work or services described in any purchase orders which may be issued by OWNER and accepted by CONTRACTOR from time to time during the term of this Agreement (the &ldquo;Work&rdquo;).&nbsp; Unless specifically excepted in the purchase order and whether specifically identified in the Scope of Work, CONTRACTOR shall furnish all things necessary to perform the Work, including, but not limited to:&nbsp; all materials, equipment, services, labor and supervision, and shall perform all such Work.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TERM</strong></p>
        <p>
            Time is of the essence with any Work being issued under this Agreement.&nbsp; Work shall be started and shall be substantially completed on the dates specified in any applicable schedule delivered by OWNER to CONTRACTOR.&nbsp; Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary, unless CONTRACTOR is otherwise advised by OWNER in writing, the term of this Agreement shall be extended until completion of any Work or services in progress.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COMPENSATION</strong></p>

All such amounts include and cover all taxes affecting the Work including, but not limited to, federal, state and local taxes relating to wages or gross receipts, and taxes based on the use, sale, purchase, processing, transportation or manufacture of equipment, materials, or supplies, and licenses and fees which are required of CONTRACTOR under this Agreement.</p>

            (b)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No overtime work or premium rates will be paid to the CONTRACTOR or authorized by the OWNER unless OWNER has expressly approved such payment in writing; provided that persons expressly designated in writing by OWNER for such purpose may give oral approval to spot overtime work followed by written confirmation of the same.&nbsp; Unless otherwise specifically agreed to in the Purchase Order or Scope of Work, overtime shall mean any hours worked in excess of 40 hours a week or on holidays, to be paid at a rate not exceeding one and one half times the standard billing rate.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1in">
            &nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The CONTRACTOR&rsquo;s Rates shall be good for a period of not less than one (1) year from the execution of this Agreement. For time and material Work, CONTRACTOR must give thirty (30) days advance written request for any proposed change in the CONTRACTOR Rates.&nbsp; No rate change or cost change will be effective until accepted by OWNER in writing, with any change being good for a period of not less than one (1) year from the effective date of the change.&nbsp; Such change will not apply to any Work in progress at time of notice without OWNER&rsquo;S written consent.</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 1in">
            (b)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each invoice must, in addition to total charges, show separately on its face</p>

        <p style="margin-left: 1in">
            OWNER reserves the right to reject CONTRACTOR invoices that fail to provide sufficient information and segregation to allow OWNER to confirm, monitor and track CONTRACTOR&rsquo;s performance of the Work.&nbsp; Any rejected invoices shall be returned to CONTRACTOR for correction and re-submittal.&nbsp; Any delay in payment of any CONTRACTOR invoices due to errors, insufficient information or segregation shall be the responsibility of the CONTRACTOR.&nbsp;</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 1in">
            &nbsp;(c)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Paragraph (b) above, OWNER shall pay CONTRACTOR&rsquo;s invoice as follows: (i) all valid invoices that are paid by OWNER within ten (10) days of receipt shall be paid at a discounted amount equal to the invoice total less two percent (2%), and (ii) if not paid within such ten (10) day period then all valid invoices shall be paid by OWNER within such time period as may be specified within OWNER&#39;s Purchase Order (or if none then within sixty (60) days of OWNER&#39;s receipt of the invoice), in accordance with OWNER&#39;s twice per month payment policy.&nbsp; Payment shall be via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT).</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 63pt">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OWNER may withhold payments for cause including but not limited to (a) nonconforming Work or services not remedied, (b) damage caused by the CONTRACTOR, its subcontractors or agents during the performance of the Work or services to the property of OWNER, another contractor or other third party, (c) a breach of any provisions of this Agreement or the Purchase Order documents, or (d) for claims made by CONTRACTOR&rsquo;s subcontractors or agents for amounts due but not paid by CONTRACTOR, or for which a lien has been filed against the work site or OWNER&rsquo;s&nbsp; property.&nbsp; Upon removal of such cause, sums withheld shall be paid to CONTRACTOR.</p>

        <p>
            OWNER may require CONTRACTOR to make minor changes in the Work which do not involve extra cost or a change in the schedule.&nbsp; Otherwise, no changes (except emergency work necessary to protect life or property) shall be made without a written change order which shall include OWNER&rsquo;s agreement to any extra charges.</p>
        <p>
            If CONTRACTOR claims that any additional instructions involve extra cost or a change in schedule, CONTRACTOR shall give OWNER written notice thereof within a reasonable time after the receipt of OWNER&rsquo;s instructions and in any event before proceeding to perform the change in Work involved.

        <p style="margin-left: 1in">
            (c)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before making any payment hereunder, OWNER may require that CONTRACTOR furnish a full and complete waiver or release of liens from the CONTRACTOR and/or from each subcontractor, materialman, artisan, or mechanic retained by CONTRACTOR in a form acceptable to the OWNER waiving or releasing any liens or claims whatever against the work to be performed herein.</p>
